## How NAPA runs

NAPA can be triggered in two ways:

### Automatic (Barton timesheets)

- When timesheets (and approved expenses) are approved in **Barton**, they sync into our system (about every hour).
- NAPA then pulls in the matching **contract** from Salesforce and **travel expenses** from Navan (by assignment).
- It consolidates the data, applies billing rules, and generates the invoice.

### Manual (upload)

- You can also **upload documents** in the Billing app: contract + timesheet + expenses, or contract + expenses.
- NAPA uses those documents to build the invoice the same way.

## What NAPA does with the data

1. **Consolidate** — Combine contract, timesheet, and expense data.
2. **Apply billing rules** — Calculate line items according to the contract (rates, caps, etc.).
3. **Check alignment** — If the rules match the contract, NAPA generates the invoice. If something doesn’t match, it flags the case for **manual review**.
4. **Invoice draft** — A draft invoice is created.
5. **Risk assessment** — The system may **auto-approve** low-risk items or send others to you for **review and approval**.
6. **Approval** — You can **review, edit if needed, approve, or reject**. Rejected items can be corrected and sent through again.
7. **Delivery** — Once approved, the invoice is synced to **NetSuite**, made available in the **client portal**, and **email notification** is sent as configured.

## Product sync (NetSuite)

Products are synced from **NetSuite** on a schedule (e.g. daily) so that when we export invoices, line items match the right products in NetSuite.
