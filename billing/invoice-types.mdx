## Two types of invoices

NAPA produces two kinds of documents, depending on who we’re billing or paying:

### Client invoice

- **Purpose:** We bill the **client** (e.g. the hospital).
- **What NAPA uses:** The **client placement order** (the contract with the client). The provider-side contract is not used for this invoice.
- **Use when:** You need to send an invoice to the client for the placement.

### Provider payout

- **Purpose:** We pay the **provider** (e.g. the nurse or locum).
- **What NAPA uses:** The **provider placement order** (the contract with the provider). The client-side contract is not used for this payout.
- **Use when:** You need to generate the payout or remittance for the provider.

In the Billing app, the flow and documents you upload (or that sync from Barton/Salesforce) determine which type is being created. If you’re unsure which type to use for a case, check with your lead or see [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).
