## When a client opens a dispute

1. **Client opens dispute** — The client raises the dispute (e.g. in the client portal or by contact).
2. **Internal review** — The billing team reviews the dispute: contract, timesheet, and the invoice line items and citations.
3. **Resolution and adjustment** — We resolve the dispute (e.g. correct the invoice, issue a credit, or confirm the original invoice) and make any needed adjustments in the system.

## What to do

- Use the **Billing app** to view the invoice, supporting documents, and NAPA’s citations (where each line item comes from).
- Follow your team’s process for logging disputes and updating status.
- For escalation or unclear cases, see [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).
