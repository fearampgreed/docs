## Getting help

- **Access or login** — If you need access to the Billing app or can’t log in, contact your manager or the person in your organization who manages billing app access (often IT or Operations).
- **How to use NAPA or the app** — Use this documentation first. For process or role-specific questions, ask your team lead or billing operations.
- **Technical issues** — If the app is down, uploads fail, or something doesn’t work as described here, report it to your IT or the technical contact your team uses. Include what you were doing and what you saw (e.g. error message or screen).
- **Disputes and approvals** — Follow your team’s process. For escalation, contact your billing lead or the contact listed in your internal runbook.

## Where to find links

Your manager or IT will provide:

- The correct **URL** for the Billing app (test, demo, or production). See [Environments](/frontend/environments).
- **Login** method (e.g. SSO or username/password).
- Any **internal runbooks or contacts** for billing and support.

If you don’t know who handles access or technical support in your organization, ask your manager or team lead.
