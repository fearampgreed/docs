## Why there are different environments

The Billing app is available in three environments so you can:

- **Test** — Try new features or data without affecting real clients or NetSuite.
- **Demo** — Show the app to stakeholders or train people with realistic but not live data.
- **Production** — Do real billing: live data, real invoices, and sync to NetSuite and clients.

## Test

- **Use for:** Trying things out, training, or testing new flows. No real client or financial impact.
- **Data:** Test/sample data. Not connected to live NetSuite or real client portals in the same way as production.
- **URL:** Your team or IT will give you the test URL (e.g. from the test billing app).

## Demo

- **Use for:** Demos and training with data that looks like production but isn’t live.
- **Data:** Demo data. Safe to use for showing the app and practicing.
- **URL:** Your team or IT will give you the demo URL.

## Production

- **Use for:** Day-to-day billing work: real contracts, timesheets, invoices, NetSuite sync, and client portal.
- **Data:** Live data. Changes here affect real invoices and systems.
- **URL:** Your team or IT will give you the production URL. Use this for normal billing operations.

## Which one to use

- **Daily billing work** → Production  
- **Demos or training** → Demo  
- **Experiments or learning** → Test  

If you’re not sure which link you have or which one to use, ask your manager or see [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).
