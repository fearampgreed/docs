## Logging in

- Use the link provided by your manager or IT (test, demo, or production). See [Environments](/frontend/environments) for the difference between them.
- Log in with the credentials or single sign-on (SSO) your organization uses. If you can’t log in, contact the person who manages access or see [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).

## Uploading documents

- When you need to run NAPA **manually** (instead of using the automatic Barton sync), go to the upload area in the app.
- Upload the **contract** and **timesheet** (and **expenses** if applicable), or contract + expenses as allowed by the flow.
- Start the run. The app will show when the job is in progress and when it’s done or needs your review.

## Reviewing and approving invoices

- When an invoice is ready for review, it will appear in your queue or the relevant section (depending on how your team uses the app).
- Open the invoice to see line items and **citations** (where each amount comes from—e.g. contract and section).
- You can **approve** (send to delivery), **reject** (send back for correction), or **edit** where the app allows. Follow your team’s approval rules.

## Handling disputes

- When a client disputes an invoice, open that invoice in the app and use the contract, timesheet, and citations to review the dispute.
- Follow your team’s process for resolving disputes and updating status. For help, see [Disputes](/billing/disputes) and [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).

## If something doesn’t work

- Check that you’re on the right environment (test vs demo vs production). See [Environments](/frontend/environments).
- If you still have issues (e.g. upload fails, wrong data, can’t approve), contact support. See [Contacts and support](/help/contacts).
